## About

In this project, I've created a few tests using Cypress to demonstrate my e2e automated testing skills to date. Cypress provides a powerful and user-friendly framework, that I'm currently learning to navigate. 
These tests aim to cover different aspects of the website showing how functionality and performance can be ensured.

## Technologies Used

- **Test Automation Framework**: Cypress, a JavaScript-based end-to-end testing framework.
- **Programming Language**: JavaScript is used to write the tests, making them accessible and easy to maintain.

- **Web Browser**: The tests are executed in Electron browser.
